It is a basic programme in pyhton that uses OpenCV to detect the motion with reference to initial image.
It captures the image at starting of programme.
Keeping the initial image as reference it identifies the change.
You can modify the level of detection or use this programme as a sub part of greater project. :)
THANK YOU!
